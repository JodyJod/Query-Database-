This Python Script will query the Adventure2019 DB and create and password excel reports.

In my line of work many end users want specific reports from the database, and due to compliance reasons each report must be password protected.

End users are in different countries and are interested in their specific country.

This script will query the database, create an excel report for each country, password protect each report and placing them in a specific folder.
